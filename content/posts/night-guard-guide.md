Grinding or jaw soreness? Learn the signs of bruxism and how custom night guards protect your teeth.

## Signs you may need a night guard
- Morning jaw pain or headaches
- Chipped or worn teeth
- Notches near the gumline (abfractions)

## Why a custom guard?

## Next steps
At your visit weâ€™ll check for wear patterns, review symptoms, and take digital impressions if a guard is right for you.
